# Kotlin Guide

The Kotlin Guide is my repository of knowledge for everything related to Kotlin and Spring (Boot). It contains things how they _should_ be done (see disclaimer below) and how I _like_ them to be done.

_Disclaimer:_ There may be notes in here that are incorrect, or not efficient, or something else not good - just assume **everything** is not safe to use in production, then we'll all be happy.
